1. How many different species of mushroom are there, if a species is identified by the attributes 1-20?

SELECT count(distinct cap_shape) * count(distinct cap_colour) * count(distinct odor) * count(distinct gill_size)
* count(distinct gill_colour) * count(distinct stalk_colour_above_ring) * count(distinct veil_colour) *
count(distinct ring_type) * count(distinct spore_print_colour) as mushroom_species from sensye.mushrooms

2. Does habitat and cap-color correlate?

with h as (
select habitat, cap_colour, count(2) as cnt_cap_colour from sensye.mushrooms
WHERE cap_colour != 'Null'
GROUP BY 1, 2
)
, tc as (
 select count(cap_colour )as total_colour, cap_colour from sensye.mushrooms
 where cap_colour != 'Null'
 GROUP BY cap_colour)
 select h.habitat, h.cap_colour, (h.cnt_cap_colour/tc.total_colour)*100 from h
 join tc on h.cap_colour = tc.cap_colour

3. Considering a specific geographical point, what colours should we be able to see in the 10 km around it?

 WITH colour as
(
SELECT latitude as lat2, longtidue as lng2, cap_colour, (
 select
  6371 * 2 * ASIN(SQRT(
              POWER(SIN((80.038 - lat2) * pi()/180 / 2),
              2) + COS(80.038 * pi()/180 ) * COS(lat2) *
              pi()/180) * POWER(SIN((-130.3698 - lng2) *
             pi()/180 / 2), 2) ))
 from sensye.mushrooms
 WHERE (select
  6371 * 2 * ASIN(SQRT(
              POWER(SIN((80.038 - latitude) * pi()/180 / 2),
              2) + COS(80.038 * pi()/180 ) * COS(latitude) *
              pi()/180) * POWER(SIN((-130.3698 - longtidue ) *
             pi()/180 / 2), 2) )) < 10
)
     SELECT distinct cap_colour from colour
